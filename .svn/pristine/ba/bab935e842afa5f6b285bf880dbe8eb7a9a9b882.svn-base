What did I work on last time?

	- Product backlog
	- Sprint1 backlog
	- Honour code

What do I plan on working on now?

	- Have a basic idea to most of the commands
	- Work on the code when possible
	- Try to finish at least 2 commands by next scrum

Am I blocked by anything?

	- Need to understand how the FileSystem is going to work so implementation can become easier
