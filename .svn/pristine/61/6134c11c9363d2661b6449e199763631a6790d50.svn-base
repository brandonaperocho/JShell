a) What did I work on last time? 
- Modified the JShell a bit
- Revised the ManCMD class
- Test file for ManCMD class
- Updated CRC cards, added CRC card for Cat
- Coded the Cat class

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
- Continue Coding the JShell 
- Finish coding and implementing the Cat command
- Test cases for Cat

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
- Mkdir and Cd have to be fixed, so I can not yet implement them into JShell
- This also causes issues with fully coding Cat
