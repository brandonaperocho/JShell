a) What did I work on last time? 
- Very basic JShell code
- ManCMD command
- Exit command
- CRC cards

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
- Coding the JShell to near-completion
- Adding the remaining CRC Cards
- Coding and implementing the cat command
- Test cases for some commands

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
- Aside from just needing the other classes finished before working
on the JShell, there should be no problems.
