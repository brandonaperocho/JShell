//Sprint 3 Backlog.

October 30th to November 5th

================================================================================================

NOTES:

1. Few CRC cards remain that are incomplete.
2. JShell requires coding for a few more cases.
3. Cat almost complete. Still waiting on echo command to be fully completed. (Echo still must
   be completed)
4. Mkdir and Cd had problems initially. So we met up as a group and completed it. (Not an
   individual effort)

================================================================================================

Implementations (from Backlog) That Are To Be Made:

1. Continue coding for the JShell (Redesgin the JShell, so that it meets specifications)
2. Complete coding for Cat, Echo classes.
3. Redesign the code for all other classes, so that it meets specifications.
(Completing all this will allow the user to perform all the actions written in the backlog.)

================================================================================================

Specific tasks:

1a. CRC Cards for the remaining classes (and any that are newly created)
2a. Attempt to Redesign JShell, handle cases
2b. Attempt to Redesign MakeDirectory, handle wrong cases
2c. Attempt to Redesign ChangeDirectory, handle wrong cases
2d. Attempt to Redesign LS, handle wrong cases
