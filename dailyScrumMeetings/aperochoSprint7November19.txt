November 19 to November 22

What did I work on last time?

	- Implemented redirection for the following commands: 
		- PWD
		- History
		- Man
		- Mkdir
		- CD
	- Changed Command execute() method from void to string and editted the commands to have no errors after
	- Fixed bugs in echo

What do I plan on working now?

	- Finish redirection for all commands
	- Help finish grep command
	- Finish/edit any JUnits for commands with redirection that are generated in STDOUT

Am I blocked on anything?

	- Nothing
