November 11 to November 14

What did I work on last time?

	- Test Cases for all of the classes I worked on
	- Final implementation of my commands into JShell
	- Javadocs and honour code in all of the classes I worked on

What do I plan on working now?

	- Adding any methods in old classes to get new commands to work
	- Make sure that the commands still work after adding 
	- Have base code for !number command
	- Try to implement it into JShell if I end up finishing it

Am I blocked on anything?

	- Nothing
