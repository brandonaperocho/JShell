a) What did I work on last time? 
- JShell Honour Code
- Product Backlog
- Sprint1 Backlog

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
- Completing all the CRC Cards
- Creating a very simplistic version of the JShell
- Beginning coding on any possible commands

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
- Due to it being so early on in the project, I lack the
other classes, so there will be trouble progressing on some
of the required coding
